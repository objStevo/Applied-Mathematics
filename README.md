Project 1-128B

This function tries to obtain an approximation to the solution of Ax=b by means of the Gauss-Seidel algorithm. 
Inputs:
 n = size
 A is an n x n matrix
 b is a vector of size n
 x0 is a first guess for the answer, so is a vector of size n
 maxit is the maximum number of iterations that should be done.
 rtol is the the tolerance for the residual, i.e. your iteration
 should stop once the size of the residual is smaller than rtol. %Output:
 x is the approximate solution produced by the algorithm
 r is the residual for the approximate solution x
